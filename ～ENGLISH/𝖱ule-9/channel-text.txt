**RULE 9 - EVERYTHING IS LOGGED**

By joining this server, you agree that all of your conversations are logged, and any edits or deletion you have made are also logged separately for the purpose of moderation. You also agree that anyone including yourself can screenshot whatever chat that you wrote here, save whatever file that you sent here, record whatever voice/stage/video sessions you participated here. This is a public server that anyone can join so long they abide the server rule and Discord's terms of service, hence you should expect it to be the same as the wider internet.
