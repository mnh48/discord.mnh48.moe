**RULE 5 - LANGUAGE LIMITATION**

I only allow the use of the following language in this server:
- Malay (all dialects - in Rumi/Latin, Jawi/Arabic, Rejang & Beringin alphabets only)
- English (all dialects - in Latin alphabet only)
- Chinese (Mandarin only - in Simplified Han & Traditional Han only)
- Japanese (standard dialect only - in Hiragana, Katakana & Kanji only)
- Indonesian (standard dialect only - in Latin, Pegon/Arabic, Rejang & Beringin alphabets only)

This is because I only understand the mentioned languages and I need to moderate the chats as well.

If you agree with this rule and want to proceed, copy and paste the text below:
